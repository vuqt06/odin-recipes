    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This authentic pho isn't quick, but it is delicious. The key is in the broth, which gets simmered for at least 6
        hours.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds beef soup bones</li>
        <li>1 onion, unpeeled and cut in half</li>
        <li>5 slices fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 pods star anise</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package dried rice noodles</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds beef top sirloin, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped green onion</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups bean sprouts</li>
        <li>1 bunch Thai basil</li>
        <li>1 lime, cut into 4 wedges</li>
        <li>1/4 cup hoisin sauce (Optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®) (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Place onion on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Place bones, onion, ginger, salt, star anise, and fish sauce in a large stockpot and cover with 4 quarts of
            water. Bring
            to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer on low for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set
            aside.</li>
        <li>Place rice noodles in large bowl filled with room temperature water and allow to soak for 1 hour. Bring a
            large pot of
            water to a boil and after the noodles have soaked, place them in the boiling water for 1 minute. Bring stock
            to a
            simmer.</li>
        <li>Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Pour hot broth over the
            top. Stir and
            let sit until the beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with bean sprouts, Thai
            basil, lime
            wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
